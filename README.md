This addon connects the [MotoPress Hotel Booking plugin](https://motopress.com/products/hotel-booking/) for WordPress with the popular Divi theme, thus allowing you to manipulate content generated by the Hotel Booking plugin using native Divi modules.

In particular, youâ€™ll be able to add any module, e.g. a search form or a room type, via the visual Divi builder interface. For each module, there is a list of settings, for example, you can opt for displaying an image, price, the book button, and more for the rooms listing using Divi toggles.

The Designs tab by Divi allows you to change the font, color, size and more of your Hotel Booking modules, without any extra tech help.

If you are on Hotel Booking and Divi, there is no need to use shortcodes anymore, tap into a more user-friendly approach of working with your favorite tools. You can use the addon with both the default Divi theme or dedicated Divi hotel templates.
