Integrates Divi theme with the MotoPress Hotel Booking plugin to modify content and styles visually via Divi builder.

== Description ==

Are you building your WordPress property rental website with the renowned Divi theme? Do you plan on implementing a scalable property management & booking system with the expert MotoPress [WordPress Hotel Booking plugin](https://motopress.com/products/hotel-booking/?utm_source=divi-hb-integration&utm_medium=pro-link-in-description)?

Then install this super lightweight utility to benefit from this duo! It removes customization limitations that appear when using Hotel Booking with Divi. This joint plugin is designed to help you tweak the styling and content generated with the Hotel Booking plugin via a familiar and user-friendly Divi Builder interface.

= Customization, Styles, Colors etc. =
No need for custom CSS code - you'll go deeper in layouts customization, button styles and colors, spacing, booking forms format, font size and more with the standard Divi toolkit and WordPress Customizer.

= Divi Builder Blocks =
Just add and alter standard MotoPress Hotel Booking widgets like properties listing or the search availability form via Divi Builder blocks. Configure all settings by ticking the buttons, without manual tinkering with shortcodes.

The Hotel Booking & Divi Integration plugin adds twelve major Hotel Booking shortcodes to the Divi Builder, while the system page shortcodes are left up to the theme styling.
